# Altland-Simons
_A study group on **Condensed Matter Field Theory** (Third Edition) by Altland and Simons_

The main purpose of this GitHub repository is to gather information (weekly schedual, presentation time and location, etc) and more importantly, to use the [Discussion](https://github.com/shwangcmt/Altland-Simons/discussions) feature. In case you haven't used GitHub before, let me tell you that the GitHub's Discussion is so cool. It supports [LaTeX](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions), which is crucial for technical discussions. It is free. Simply sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) account, and you are good to go. 

We highly encourage you to post your questions on the Discussion page, as it fosters engagement for everyone. Formulating your questions clearly and sharing them publicly not only enhances your understanding but also helps reinforce your memory. GitHub allows you to [watch](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) a repository and receive notifications from it. 

The book is available online from our library at [here](https://search.library.ucr.edu/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9919759025006531&context=L&vid=01CDL_RIV_INST:UCR&lang=en&search_scope=Everything&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,altland%20simons&sortby=date_d&facet=frbrgroupid,include,9083417688746215883&offset=0). A copy can be purchased from, e.g. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Condensed-Matter-Theory-Alexander-Altland/dp/1108494609/).
